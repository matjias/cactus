# Cactus

We have implemented a prototype for micro-goal setting. The user can set small goals, which will automatically be shared on a public feed. Everyone can then use this to provide feedback for others, or gain inspiration from otherâ€™s goals. To keep users motivated, they will have to take care of their own little Cactus, which will only grow upon completing tasks, and participating in the public feed. 

## Installation
The app can be installed from the Cactus.apk in the root folder.

## Implementation
The main file is cactus/App.js. Most parts implemented are within the cactus/screens folder and cactus/components. These, respectively, make up the different screens in the app and their main subcomponents.
